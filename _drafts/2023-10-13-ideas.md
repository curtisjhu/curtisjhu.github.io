No matter what you choose, build stuff and be around smart people.  “Stuff” can be a lot of different things

Working on something good will pull you along a path where good things keep happening to you.  (In fact, this effect is so strong that there’s a danger of getting sucked into too many interesting things and getting distracted from what you really want to do.)

If you stay in college, make sure you learn something worthwhile and work on interesting projects—college is probably the best place to meet people to work with. 

personal burn rate low and minimize your commitments.  I have seen a lot of people miss great opportunities because they couldn’t afford a reduction in salary or because they couldn’t move or didn’t have the time.

The risk is not getting on the path where you get to be right that one critical time.
