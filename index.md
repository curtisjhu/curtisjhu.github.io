<!-- Current position and things happening in my life -->

Hello, I'm Curtis Hu. I'm an undergraduate at <a href="">UC Berkeley</a>. My research lies in Deep Learning for Hadronic Interactions for <a href="https://xju2.github.io/students/">Dr. Xiangyang Ju</a> under the <a href="https://www.physics.lbl.gov/atlas/">ATLAS group</a> at <a href="https://www.physics.lbl.gov/">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>. When I'm not running experiments on the <a href="https://www.nersc.gov/">NERSC supercomputer</a>, I also do some teaching for <a href="https://c88c.org/fa23/">cs88c</a>. 


<!-- Who i worked with, big names preferably -->
I've had the privilege of working with some of the brightest and most interesting minds on the planet. I've worked with my graduate student <a href="https://www.pi.uni-bonn.de/brock/en/results/data/t00000052.pdf">Thilo Scharnhorst</a> with teaching <a href="https://funnyscar.com/writings/">quantum machine learning algorithms</a>. I've worked with amazing team at <a href="https://www.berkeleyse.org/">Space Enterprise at Berkeley</a> to get the <a href="https://www.berkeleyse.org/eureka1">E1 Rocket</a> past 11000 ft into the air.


Some pet project of mine include <a href="https://funnyscar.com/">content creation of mathematical topics</a>. I've created some <a href="https://funnyscar.com/projects">miscellaneous projects</a> there too.


<!-- Hobbies, show that you're human and easy to get along and that they should reach out -->
I have a side blog analyzing Nobel-Prize-winning <a href="https://curtishu.medium.com">Bob Dylan songs</a>. I've liked to <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/curtis_hu">run long distances</a> since high school cross country. I love to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/curtisjhu
">read books</a> and occasionally taking <a href="https://flickr.com/people/curtisjhu">photos</a>.
