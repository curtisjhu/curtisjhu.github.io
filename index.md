<!-- Current position and things happening in my life -->

Hello, I'm Curtis Hu. I'm an undergraduate at <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">University of California, Berkeley</a> studying Physics and Computer Science. This past summer, I've had the wonderful opportunity to work directly under the direct mentorship of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/branson-stephens-19b75855/">Dr. Branson Stephens</a> and <a href="http://militzer.berkeley.edu/~driver/">Dr. Kevin Driver</a> on experimenting with <a href="https://bucket.funnyscar.com/work/publications/llnl-poster-2024.pdf">hydrocode boundary conditions</a> for <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-national-laboratory-makes-history-achieving-fusion-ignition">fusion ignition</a> experiments at <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/">Lawerence Livermore National Laboratory.</a> Before that, I've worked on deep learning algorithms to simulate hadronic interactions under <a href="https://xju2.github.io/students/">Dr. Xiangyang Ju</a> at <a href="https://www.physics.lbl.gov/">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>. 

<!-- Show off some work -->

<!-- Teaching -->
<!-- Who I worked with, big names preferably -->

I've also have the opportunity to teach <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su24/staff/">Intro to Artificial Intelligence (CS188)</a> and <a href="">Intro to Optics, Relativity, Quantum Mechanics (PHYS 7C)</a>.
A pet project of mine is <a href="https://funnyscar.com/">creating fun little code art</a>. I've created some <a href="https://funnyscar.com/projects">miscellaneous projects</a> there too.


<!-- Hobbies, show that you're human and easy to get along and that they should reach out -->
I've liked to <a href="https://www.athlinks.com/athletes/540536124/">run long distances</a> since high school cross country. I love to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/curtisjhu
