Here are some failing attempts to categorize myself. I'm a Physics/CS student at <a href="https://physics.berkeley.edu/">University of California, Berkeley</a>. Hoping to work at the frontier of technology.

This past summer, I've gotten to chance to explore the world of quantitative finance at <a href="https://www.tanius.com/">Tanius Technology LLC</a>. Specifically, I wrote data analytics over TCP packet traffic in a large C++ codebase. Additionally, I wrote a some strategies taking use of funding rate arbitrage and the autocorrelation of perpetuals across exchanges.

The previous summer, I had the chance to work directly under the direct mentorship of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/branson-stephens-19b75855/">Dr. Branson Stephens</a> and <a href="http://militzer.berkeley.edu/~driver/">Dr. Kevin Driver</a> on experimenting with <a href="https://bucket.funnyscar.com/work/publications/llnl-poster-2024.pdf">hydrocode boundary conditions</a> for <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-national-laboratory-makes-history-achieving-fusion-ignition">fusion ignition</a> experiments at <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/">Lawerence Livermore National Laboratory. 

<!-- Show off some work -->

<!-- Teaching -->
<!-- Who I worked with, big names preferably -->

I've also have the opportunity to teach different courses such as <a href="https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/su25/staff/">Computer Graphics (CS184)</a>, <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su24/staff/">Intro to Artificial Intelligence (CS188)</a> and <a href="">Intro to Optics, Relativity, Quantum Mechanics (PHYS 7C)</a>.


<!-- Hobbies, show that you're human and easy to get along and that they should reach out -->
 If you're into the outdoors, I love adventures and <a href="https://www.athlinks.com/athletes/540536124/">running</a>. Expounding curiosity takes me across the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/curtisjhu
">ancient and modern tree of knowledge</a>. I like to explore music as well I suppose: <a href="https://instagram.com/curtisjhu">moosic</a>.
